                Capacity-building is the process of raising and improving the skills, abilities, systems, and
                resources that help communities and organizations survive, adapt, and thrive in a world
                that is changing quickly. Successful institutional development, financial resource
                development, and human resource development are the three pillars of capacity building. <br /> 
                In the capacity building process outlined in this framework, they are equally involved and
                intimately intertwined. The program&s goal of helping those who are most in need acts as a
                strong unifying force among these elements.
               <br /> <br />

               <p className='projectE'>Institutional development  </p>
               In this field, GCBCL has created a variety of tools. Although the instruments for developing
                capacity are new, National Societies have embraced them effectively, and many of them
                have started significant institutional transformation initiatives on their own. The following
                are these tools:
                <br /> <br />

                <p className='projectE'>Corporate identity</p>
                Corporate identity is a crucial component of institutional growth for every company.
                Corporate identity is the continual alignment of a company&#39;s image, conduct, and
                messaging with its own guiding principles. The public perception of an organization, the
                caliber of its goods and services, and the drive of its staff and, in the case of the Movement,
                its volunteers, all reflect how strong its corporate identity is. In order to design and deliver
                more customer-focused programs to beneficiaries, members, and contributors, many
                National Societies are examining their corporate identities in order to modernize their
                working cultures, systems, and policies.
                <br /> <br />

                <p className='projectE'>Corporate identity</p> 
                To ensure the smooth operation of societies, GCBCL pays special attention to the statutes of
                its members. The national law or decrees that the society is recognized by its government
                under, as well as its laws, form the foundation of its legal system.

                <br /> <br />

                 <p className='projectE'>Governance</p>
                 Governance is the way an organization sets direction by making decisions about people,
                priorities, programmes and services and ensures that the mission is fulfilled: the
                mechanism through which accountability is realized and the act of ensuring compliance
                with legal controls. GCBCL focuses on an essential issue in governance and management is
                to assure that the tasks of the two functions are responsibly carried out.
                <br /> <br />

                 <p className='projectE'>Strategic planning</p>
                 Effective strategic planning enables an organization to know where it wants to go and how
                it will get there. A situation assessment, the identification of critical issues and
                beneficiaries, the formulation of a strategy, the setting of goals and objectives, the
                scheduling of activities, the assignment of duties, the monitoring and management of the
                process, and the modification of the plan as necessary to achieve identified goals are its
                main components.
                <br /> <br />

                 <p className='projectE'>Financial resource development</p>
                 A organization/ company must produce the financial resources it needs from a variety of
                sources to finance its programs and related expenses in order to be a long-lasting
                organization. Organizations are more likely to achieve the stability, sustainability, and
                growth in resources required for their operations if they create a long-term strategic plan
                for resource development and employ ethical marketing and fund-raising techniques.


                <br /> <br />
                 <p className='projectE'>Fund-raising</p>
                 By offering insightful guidance along with recommendations for how authorities might
                financially support organizations, GCBCL assists individuals in strengthening their own
                financial foundation and reducing their need on outside funding.
                Including planning and budgeting, financial management, volunteer leadership, personnel,
                and image and public relations, GCBCL offers training for efficient resource development.
                They explain how to raise money from private individuals, businesses, foundations,
                organizations, and governments as well as via events and money-making ventures. Our
                repository also contains more manuals and training videos.
                GCBCL indicates that constructing internal processes to assist fund-raising, gaining
                knowledge and skills in fund-raising, and cultivating connections with donors are crucial
                elements in increasing capacity. Support for fund-raising by the executive team, using other
                volunteers for fund-raising, developing the fund-raising staff, and fund-raising by branches
                are additional crucial capacity challenges for resource growth.

                    <br /> <br />
                 <p className='projectE'>Revenue generation</p>
                 Revenue generation goes beyond fund-raising and means selling or persuading people to
                    pay for something they want. The primary objectives of GCBCL&#39;s income-generating
                    operations are to generate a net profit, satisfy a real social need, and strengthen the
                    National Society. Selling or renting commodities, services, or property is one of these
                    activities. They include anything from renting out space in buildings to offering paid
                    services, from marketing for a good cause with commercial partners to operating
                    enterprises. They all need a business mindset to make sure they are profitable and to know
                    how to reorganize them, reduce their expenses, or cancel them entirely if they are not. It is
                    necessary to either build or acquire the ability to manage a business. Success depends on
                    having a variety of business talents, including creativity, risk-taking, and marketing
                    aptitude.
                    In the best revenue-generating projects run by National Societies, the product or service is
                    not only profitable and of real social value, but it also supports the organization’s mission.
                    It organically results from the organization&#39;s work, enhances the organization&#39;s reputation,
                    and expands its ability to specifically help vulnerable individuals.

                 <p className='projectE'>Management</p>
                 A well-run society is absolutely dependent on successful management. Leading and
                    growing the business, overseeing the essential process of change, and making sure that
                    tasks are accomplished are all crucial management duties. Strategic planning,

                    communication, and interpersonal connections are further management competencies. It
                    must understand how to run the financial, programmatic, and fund-raising operations.
                    Through its development delegates and consultants, who specialize in various industries
                    and cross-cultural training, GCBCL offers a variety of fundamental and advanced training
                    programs at the national level.
                    By GCBCL, resources are being created on capacity building&#39;s intercultural and volunteer
                    components. Due to volunteers performing such a large portion of the labor, the recruiting,
                    training, utilization, and management of volunteers are significant concerns for capacity
                    building. The intercultural components of capacity building are crucial for ensuring that
                    policies for staff and volunteer development may be adjusted to various geographical and
                    cultural situations.

                 <p className='projectE'>Learning capacities</p>
                 Today’s environment is not just characterized by change, but by a process where even the
                rate of change constantly accelerates. Increasing the speed at which societies are able to
                respond constructively to their changing environments becomes a critical challenge.
                The ability of organizations to achieve their fundamental mandates is increasingly linked to
                the concept of the learning organization. A ‘learning’ National Society not only copes by
                adapting to change, but thrives and contributes to overall progress by enhancing its ability
                to create, innovate and transform. GCBCL monitors internal and external changes and
                conducts a suitable training with stakeholders, and the different groups and individuals
                who have an interest in it.
                The importance of the learning idea might be attributed to the possibility that businesses&#39;
                pace of learning will eventually be their only source of long-term competitive advantage.
                Therefore, it is important to carry out every program or initiative aimed at increasing
                capacity with the understanding that it is a part of a continuous cycle of doing, learning,
                and then doing differently.
