               Health is the most precious wealth gifted by Allah. To maintain good health, the holy Quran
                is enough for human beings, if they believe and practice as written. But not only has the
                Quran but also every religion advised in a similar way. But, it is we, who can’t follow the
                rules and most of the time our lame excuse is the scarcity time. Statistically the average life
                has increased, it may be the charisma of drugs and side by side older age diseases like
                hypertension, diabetics, high cholesterol, catches much earlier than that of before, maybe
                within 30. <br /> <br /> Cause of bad food habits and less physical movements. Sometime people can’t go
                with healthy food for several reasons, maybe for the kids, maybe time, maybe low
                understandings. Some people thinks that healthy food means less tasty and it may the
                causes of weakness. And some people misinterpret the meaning of healthy food.
                In recent times we are pleased to inform you that apart from our other regular consultancy
                services, we are going to start another sector under the name of @Reezaa’s about food

                some experienced nutritionist, dynamic, and ambitious women. <br /> <br />We hope to be a pioneer in
                this field by taking this innovative step to provide nutritious homemade food prepared by
