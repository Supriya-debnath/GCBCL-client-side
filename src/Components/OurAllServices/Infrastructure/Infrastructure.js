            <h4>INFRASTRUCTURE CONSULTING</h4>
      
            <p>We will help clients improve on-time and on-budget delivery of major projects and get the
            most out of existing capital assets.</p>

            <ul>
                <li className='infras'>PROJECT CONCEPTUALISATION AND PLANNING</li>
                <p>We help client to invent or formulate an idea or concept. The conceptual phase of
                    a project occurs in the initial design activity when the scope of the project is
                    drafted and a list of the desired design features and requirements is created.</p>

                <li className='infras'>STRATEGY AND BUSINESS PLANNING</li>
                <p>We prepares detailed project plan that is a set of living documents that can be
                expected to change over the life of the project. Like a roadmap, it provides the
                direction for the project. And like the traveler, the project manager needs to set
                the course for the project, which in project management terms means creating
                the project plan. Just as a driver may encounter road construction or new routes
                to the final destination, the project manager may need to correct the project
                course as well. <br />
                A common misconception is that the plan equates to the project timeline, which
                is only one of the many components of the plan. The project plan is the major
                work product from the entire planning process, so it contains all the planning
                documents for the project.
